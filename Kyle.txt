As you can see there is just the Kyle.txt file were from now on you will receive instructions!

You see... I lost my cat and I need to find it as soon as possible can you help me bring him back to his house?

He's somewhere in the messy branch and i want to rescue him :(

1) Go to the "Messy" branch and look for him with git log

2) Go to the corresponding commit (git checkout <the commit>)

3) Don't erase anything!

4) Create a new file in that commit where the cat is placed with instructions of how to feed him

5) Save that commit 

6) Merge that commit to the Kyle branch
