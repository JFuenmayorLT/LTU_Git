As you can see there is just the Kyle.txt file were from now on you will receive instructions!

You see... I lost my cat and I need to find it as soon as possible can you help me bring him back to his house?

He's somewhere in the messy branch and i want to rescue him :(

1) Go to the "Messy" branch and look for him with git log

2) Go to the corresponding commit (git checkout <the commit>)

3) Earse all the other files you don't need

4) Save the changes on git and merge the commit in the Kyle branch
